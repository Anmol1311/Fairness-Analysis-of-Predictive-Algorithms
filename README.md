# Fairness-Analysis-of-Predictive-Algorithms

## Project Overview and Objective
In recent years, the criminal justice system has increasingly turned to technological advancements to enhance decisionmaking processes. Among these technologies, predictive algorithms stand out as powerful tools designed to estimate the likelihood of an individual reoffending. These algorithms, which are employed at various stages of the criminal process, ncluding parole decisions, sentencing, and notably bail hearings, leverage historical data to generate predictions about future behaviors.

While the use of these predictive algorithms in criminal justice enhances decision-making, it also raises ethical concerns. As these systems are deployed as decision-support tools influencing individual outcomes, it is vital
to address question of fairness of these algorithms.

One such predictive tool is COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) which evaluates the risk of recidivism among criminals. In this project, we utilized the hostorical COMPAS data to evaluate the fairness levels of the prediction algorithm.
